            <h2>"What do I use my pick ticket on?"</h2>
            <p>
                If you have Kitasan at 1~3LB, you'll likely want to use the ticket to increase her limit breaks. If you have Kitasan at 0LB, bringing her to 2LB still isn't good, and if you have her at MLB, you obviously don't need to use it on her. In those cases, using it on Super Creek is best, or Fine Motion if your Super Creek is already good. If you have all three of those MLB, idk, whatever seems useful. As for the gem, same story for people with 1~2LB Kitasan, use it to get her to 3LB/MLB. For the others, save it, it's very valuable.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>To summarize, how many copies of Kitasan do you have?</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>0~1:</strong> Ticket Creek, save gem (if you're thinking about pulling the Kitasan rerun, you may wish to save the ticket until then, but F2P players can safely skip that banner)</li>
                <li><strong>2~3:</strong> Ticket and gem Kitasan</li>
                <li><strong>4:</strong> Ticket Kitasan, save gem</li>
                <li><strong>5:</strong> Ticket Creek, save gem</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Current Banner Reviews</h2>
            <p>
                You may also wish to check the Ideal Support Card Banner Pulls and Umas to Watch For sections for an idea of what you might need to be saving for in the future, keeping in mind that each scenario will be 4 months long and you can expect to get roughly one pity per month or two. The yearly F2P income was calculated on the JP server to be around 300k Carats. Some things are powerful, but for short periods of time, and so aren't worth pulling if you aren't a whale.
            </p>

            <h3>Support Banners</h3>
            <p>
                There are two kinds of desirable cards. There are cards that give good skills, where you only need one or two copies, like Bijin, and cards that you use to raise your stats, where you want them MLB, like Kitasan. Some cards can fulfill either role, like Creek. If you need the card MLB, you should have two pities before pulling on that banner. If it's a skill card, pull with one pity ready, but stop once you get the card. Also, banners with two SSRs are generally better to pull on, as getting random off-rate support cards is usually not helpful due to SRs outperforming most low-LB SSRs.
            </p>

            <h4>(Nov 24) Rob Roy + Tamamo - Good Skill Card</h4>
            <p>
                Rob Roy has a gold heal for Late Surgers on a Speed card, which can be quite valuable especially for Team Trials training. If you're a Late Surger specialist, maybe aiming for a copy could be valuable, but you probably just borrow her.
            </p>

            <h4>(Dec 1) Muteki + Seiun - Good Skill Card</h4>
            <p>
                Muteki is mostly used because she gives high hints for Team Trials or parent umas. Seiun's skill is good for Front Runners. Nothing to go crazy over.
            </p>

            <h4>(Dec 8) Festa + Sirius SR - Skip</h4>
            <p>
                Single SSR banner, and the SSR isn't particularly good. Easy skip.
            </p>

            <h4>(Dec 14) Brian + Curren - Good Skill Card</h4>
            <p>
                Curren's skill is a gambling skill for Sprint races that anyone can use. Brian's skill is generic straight speed, but not really what you want out of a Stamina card right now. Usually, you just borrow cards like Curren that have specific skills.
            </p>

            <h4>(Dec 18) Kitasan + Pasa - Great Training Cards</h4>
            <p>
                You don't need to pull this banner. In Scenario 3, Kita is not the best. In 4 and 5, she is good, but you'll have replacements during 4 in Maruzensky and Tachyon, and then you can have good enough cards that you just borrow her in 5. In Scenario 6, she gets powercrept by Pasa. If you're a whale you can pull here, but if you're F2P, it's probably better to save for the two upcoming Speed card banners that have free pulls. An exception might be if you can get her to 3+LB guaranteed in a single spark.
            </p>
            <p>
                I made a video going over it in depth: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" target="_blank">Should you pull the Kitasan rerun banner? - Umamusume Pretty Derby</a>
            </p>

            <h4>(Dec 28) Helios + Vodka SR - Good Skill Card</h4>
            <p>
                Helios gives a great Front Runner skill, the same one the Seiun Sky Stamina card does. But, she's on a banner with an SR, so it's an easy skip.
            </p>

            <h2>Support Cards</h2>
            <p>
                There are very few must-pull support cards early in the game. Kitasan Black, Fine Motion, Super Creek are the earliest ones - and Fine Motion doesn't even get a banner. A bit later, Maruzensky and Fuku Speed, Nice Nature and CB Wits are good though style-specific. The card quality really starts going up around the fifth scenario, Grandmasters. So, you have a lot of leeway to pull on umas you like early on.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pal and Group cards are an interesting thing. They are usually the most powerful cards in their scenario. In scenarios 2 (Unity Cup) and 4 (Grand Live), the Rare version of them is perfectly serviceable, but after that, the SSRs start becoming mandatory. You can either pull them yourself, or borrow them for 4 months. Having them yourself means you can borrow other things so it's generally advised starting in scenario 5, Grandmasters to pull for each scenario's SSR Pal/Group cards. The initial banners for scenarios also usually have a lot of free pulls to help you reach the pity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throne is a Group card that released about 2 weeks before the end of scenario 3. She was extremely meta defining for those two weeks, but then disappeared off the face of the earth. If they release her near the start of scenario 3 this time around, maybe you want her.
            </p>

            <h2>Ideal Support Card Banner Pulls</h2>
            <p>
                Some of the competitive Uma JP players looked through the past banners to see what they would pull on as free to play players, in retrospect. The banners on EN may not be exactly the same, but this can give you an idea of what to look out for. Unless otherwise noted, Roll generally means 400 pulls or until MLB, whichever comes first.
            </p>
            <div class="note-box">
                <strong>Note:</strong> ★ indicates we had 50~100 free pulls on this banner on the Japanese server
            </div>

            <h3>URA</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>(Re)roll on <strong>Kitasan/Dia</strong> for Kitasan - can last you up until L'Arc</li>
                <li>Roll on <strong>Creek/Tazuna</strong> if you need SRs. You can MLB Creek with SSR pick tickets over time so she's not a high priority, but if you want to do early pulls this is the banner for it</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Unity Cup</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>★ Roll on <strong>Riko/Rice</strong> a little, 0LB Riko SSR is fine and Rice is useful for double heals. Riko remains meta in MANT and could even be used in Grand Live, Rice is mostly only for Unity Cup</li>
                <li>★ Roll on <strong>Fuku/Ayabe</strong> for Fuku if you can, otherwise roll the Top Road banner</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>MANT</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>★ Roll on <strong>Narita Top Road</strong> if you didn't roll Fuku, you want at least one of them for this scenario. The Ayabe SR card from this banner is also great in MANT</li>
                <li>If Throne banner is moved to the start of MANT, you might want to pull for it</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Grand Live</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>★ Roll on <strong>Hello/Tachyon</strong> - Scenario Banner. Tachyon falls off, so just 1 pity here for Hello</li>
                <li>Roll on <strong>Maru/Fine Motion</strong> - Both amazing cards at this point</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Grandmasters</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>★ Roll on <strong>Ramonu</strong> - Becomes best Wit card</li>
                <li>Roll on <strong>Goddess</strong> - Scenario card. One pity, 200 pulls</li>
                <li>★ Roll on <strong>Bourbon/Laurel</strong> for 1LB Bourbon for the Front Runners skill (LoH meta)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>L'Arc</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>★ Roll on <strong>Pasa/Mei</strong> - Scenario Banner. Pasa basically directly power creeps Kitasan</li>
                <li>Maybe roll on <strong>McQueen</strong> - Better than Ramonu, but Pace Chaser focused, not a huge upgrade</li>
                <li>Roll on <strong>Sounds of Earth</strong> - Strong card that can give a good speed skill. Creek is still usable, but sometimes you want a Stamina card but not a heal</li>
                <li>★ Roll on <strong>Duramente/Dia</strong> for Dura if your free rolls are good, not a huge upgrade</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>UAF</h3>
            <div class="note-box">
                <strong>Note:</strong> From here on, scenarios went from 6 months long to 4 months
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>★ Roll on <strong>Orfe/Ryoka</strong> - Scenario Banner, both very strong</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>GFF</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>★ Roll on <strong>Nishino/Yayoi</strong> - Scenario Banner, both very strong</li>
                <li>Roll on <strong>Falco/Rickey</strong> for 1LB Falco for the Front Runners skill (LoH meta)</li>
                <li>★ Roll on <strong>Still In Love</strong> - Upgrade for Speed</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Mecha</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>★ Roll on <strong>Shakur/Daiwa</strong> - Shakur becomes best Stamina, Long decks Shakur+Creek/SoE</li>
                <li>★ Roll on <strong>Rudolf/Ardan</strong> - Rudolf replaces Ramonu/McQueen as best Wit</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Twinkle Legends</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>★ Roll on <strong>Almond Eye/Legends</strong> - Scenario Banner, Almond Eye mostly power creeps Pasa</li>
            </ul>
